# Certificate Issuance System.

## üìù Description
"Avacertify": Certificate Issuance System is a decentralized application (dApp) that uses smart contracts on a blockchain (like Avalanche) to issue, verify, and revoke certificates¬†securely.

## üí• Features

‚û°Ô∏è**1. Issue Certificates**

Functionality: The contract owner (issuer) creates a certificate for a recipient.

How It Works:
- A unique Certificate ID is assigned.
- The recipient‚Äôs name, course, and issue date are stored.
- An event log is generated¬†for¬†tracking.

‚û°Ô∏è**2. Verify certificate.**

Functionality: Anyone can check if a certificate is valid.

How It Works:
- The blockchain stores certificate data.
- A function retrieves the details using the¬†certificate¬†ID.

‚û°Ô∏è**3. Revoke certificate.**

Functionality: The issuer can revoke a certificate if needed.

How It Works:
- The smart contract updates the certificate status to false.
- Revoked certificates can no longer be verified¬†as¬†valid.

## My Next.js App

This project is a full-stack application consisting of a frontend built with Next.js and a backend server. 

## Frontend

The frontend is located in the `frontend` directory and is built using React with TypeScript. It includes:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components are located in the `components` directory.
- **Pages**: The main entry point for the application is in the `pages` directory, including the homepage and custom app component.
- **Public Assets**: Static files such as images and fonts are stored in the `public` directory.
- **Styles**: Global CSS styles are defined in the `styles` directory.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: The `tsconfig.json` file contains TypeScript compiler options.
- **Package Configuration**: The `package.json` file lists dependencies and scripts for the frontend.

## Backend

The backend is located in the `backend` directory and is responsible for handling server-side logic. It includes:

- **App Entry Point**: The main server setup is in `src/app.ts`.
- **Type Definitions**: Shared types and interfaces are defined in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Package Configuration**: The `package.json` file lists dependencies and scripts for the backend.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: The `tsconfig.json` file contains TypeScript compiler options.

## Database


Firebase Integration

Waitlist Form: Stores users details(name, email and interest).

Profile: Retrieves users details.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
